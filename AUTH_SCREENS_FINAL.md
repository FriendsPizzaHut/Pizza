---

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### **1. Keyboard Disappearing Issue (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Problem:** 
- Tapping any input field caused keyboard to appear and immediately disappear
- Made it impossible to type in forms
- Affected ALL authentication screens

**Solution:**
- Changed `KeyboardAvoidingView` behavior from `'height'` to `undefined` on Android
- Removed `bounces={false}` from ScrollView
- Set `keyboardVerticalOffset` to `0` for both platforms
- Added `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"`

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `Login.tsx`
- ✅ `Signup.tsx`  
- ✅ `DeliveryBoySignup.tsx`

**Result:** Keyboard now works perfectly on all screens! 🎉

### **2. Vehicle Type Button Overlap**

**Problem:**
- Vehicle type buttons were too tall (padding 16px)
- Vehicle number input field was overlapping the buttons above
- Icons were too large (28px)

**Solution:**
- Reduced button `paddingVertical` from `16` to `12`
- Reduced icon size from `28` to `20`
- Changed button layout to `flexDirection: 'row'` (icon + text side-by-side)
- Added `marginBottom: 8` to container
- Added inline `marginBottom: 24` to vehicle type input group

**Result:** Clean, compact layout with proper spacing! ✨

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **KeyboardAvoidingView Configuration:**
```tsx
// iOS - Uses padding to push content up
behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : undefined}

// Android - Uses native handling (undefined)
// This lets Android manage keyboard naturally

keyboardVerticalOffset={0}  // No offset needed
```

### **ScrollView Configuration:**
```tsx
<ScrollView
    contentContainerStyle={styles.scrollContent}
    keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"  // ✅ Keeps keyboard open
    showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}
    // bounces={false} ❌ Removed - was causing issues
>
```

### **Input Field Focus States:**
```tsx
const [focusedField, setFocusedField] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Applied to each input:
style={[
    styles.inputContainer,
    focusedField === 'email' && styles.inputFocused,
    validationErrors.email && styles.inputError
]}
onFocus={() => setFocusedField('email')}
onBlur={() => setFocusedField(null)}
```

### **Vehicle Type Buttons:**
```tsx
// Compact row layout
flexDirection: 'row',
paddingVertical: 12,  // Reduced from 16
gap: 8,

// Icon size
<MaterialIcons size={20} />  // Reduced from 28
```
