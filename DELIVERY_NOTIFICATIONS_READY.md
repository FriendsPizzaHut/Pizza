# 🚚 Delivery Agent Notifications - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Status: READY TO TEST

Delivery agents now receive instant push notifications when orders are assigned to them!

---

## 🎯 What's Implemented

### **Notification Trigger**
When an admin assigns an order to a delivery agent:
1. ✅ Backend sends push notification via Firebase
2. ✅ Delivery agent receives notification instantly
3. ✅ Works in all app states (foreground, background, closed)

### **Notification Content**
```
Title: 🚚 New Delivery Assignment!
Body: Order #ORD-XXX - 3 items • ₹450.00
      Deliver to: John Doe
```

### **Notification Data (for navigation)**
- Order ID
- Order Number
- Item Count
- Total Amount
- Customer Name
- Customer Address
- Customer Phone

---

## 📁 Files Modified

### **Backend**
1. **`firebaseService.js`** - Added `notifyDeliveryAgentOrderAssigned()`
   ```javascript
   export const notifyDeliveryAgentOrderAssigned = async (order, deliveryAgentId)
   ```

2. **`orderController.js`** - Calls notification on assignment
   ```javascript
   // After assigning delivery agent
   notifyDeliveryAgentOrderAssigned(order, deliveryAgentId).catch(err => {
       console.error('[ORDER] Failed to send push notification:', err);
   });
   ```

### **Frontend**
3. **`DeliveryNavigator.tsx`** - Added NotificationInitializer
   ```typescript
   <NotificationInitializer role="delivery" />
   ```

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Setup:**
1. **Login as Delivery Agent** on Device A (or emulator)
2. **Login as Admin** on Device B (your phone)
3. **Place Order** as customer (can use same device as admin)

### **Test Flow:**
1. Customer places order
2. Admin navigates to Order Management
3. Admin taps on the order
4. Admin taps "Assign Delivery Agent"
5. Admin selects a delivery agent
6. **Delivery Agent receives notification!** 🎉

### **Expected Behavior:**

**App in Foreground:**

- Tap → Opens order details

**App in Background:**
- Notification appears in notification tray
- Device may vibrate/sound
- Tap → Opens app to order details

**App Closed:**
- Device wakes up
- Notification appears
- Tap → Opens app to order details

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### **Backend Function**
```javascript
export const notifyDeliveryAgentOrderAssigned = async (order, deliveryAgentId) => {
    const notificationData = {
        orderId: order._id.toString(),
        orderNumber: order.orderNumber,
        itemCount: order.items?.length || 0,
        total: order.totalAmount,
        customerName: order.deliveryAddress?.name || 'Customer',
        customerAddress: `${order.deliveryAddress?.street}, ${order.deliveryAddress?.city}`,
        customerPhone: order.contactPhone,
    };

    return await sendNotificationToUsers([deliveryAgentId], 'order:assigned', notificationData);
};
```

### **Notification Template**
```javascript
'order:assigned': {
    title: '🚚 New Delivery Assignment!',
    body: `Order #${data.orderNumber} - ${data.itemCount} items • ₹${data.total}
Deliver to: ${data.customerName}`,
}
```

### **Auto-initialization**

## ✨ Additional Notifications (Future Enhancement)

You can easily add more delivery agent notifications:

```javascript
export const notifyDeliveryAgentOrderReady = async (order, deliveryAgentId) => {
    // Notify when restaurant marks order as ready
};
```

### **Customer Message**
```javascript
export const notifyDeliveryAgentCustomerMessage = async (message, deliveryAgentId) => {
    // Notify when customer sends message
};
```

### **Payment Collected**
```javascript
export const notifyAdminPaymentCollected = async (order) => {
    // Notify admin when delivery agent collects payment
};
```
