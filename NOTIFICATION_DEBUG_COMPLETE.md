## 🚀 How to Test:

### Step 1: Navigate to Debug Screen

Add this button to your **AdminDashboard** or any admin screen:

```typescript
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';

// In your component:
const navigation = useNavigation<any>();

<TouchableOpacity 
  style={{
    backgroundColor: '#FF6B35',
    padding: 15,
    borderRadius: 8,
    margin: 16,
  }}
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('NotificationDebug')}
>
  <Text style={{ color: 'white', fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 'bold', textAlign: 'center' }}>
    🔔 Open Notification Debug
  </Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### Step 2: Run Tests in Order

1. **Tap "1️⃣ Test Permissions"**
   - Should show: `✅ Permissions already granted` or request them
   
2. **Tap "2️⃣ Get Push Token"**
   - Should show token like: `ExponentPushToken[...]`
   - Should show token length: ~41 characters
   - Should validate format

3. **Tap "3️⃣ Send Local Notification"**
   - Should appear **immediately** (1-2 seconds)
   - If this works → Listeners are fine
   - If this doesn't work → Permission or listener issue

4. **Tap "4️⃣ Register with Backend"**
   - Should show: `✅ Token registered with backend`

5. **Tap "5️⃣ Send from Backend (Ping)"**
   - Should show: `✅ Backend sent notification`
   - **Wait 5-30 seconds** for notification to arrive
   - If this works → Full system is working!

6. **Tap "6️⃣ Test Listeners"**
   - Sets up temporary listeners
   - Then use Test 3 or 5 to send notification
   - Should see alert popup when notification arrives

7. **Tap "🚀 Run Full Test Flow"**
   - Runs all tests automatically
   - Watch the logs for any errors

## 📊 What to Look For:

### Success Logs:
```
✅ [NOTIFICATIONS] Permission granted
✅ [NOTIFICATIONS] Expo push token: ExponentPushToken[...]
✅ [NOTIFICATIONS] Token registered successfully
🎧 [NOTIFICATIONS] Setting up notification listeners...
✅ [NOTIFICATIONS] Foreground listener registered
✅ [NOTIFICATIONS] Tap listener registered
✅ [NOTIFICATIONS] Android channel created
```

### When Notification Arrives:
```
⚡ [NOTIFICATIONS] Handler called for notification: ...
📦 [NOTIFICATIONS] Notification content: {...}
📬 [NOTIFICATIONS] Notification received (foreground): ...

❌ [NOTIFICATIONS] Permission denied
❌ [NOTIFICATIONS] No push token available
❌ [NOTIFICATIONS] Error registering token
❌ [NOTIFICATIONS] Failed to get token
```

## 🎯 Diagnosis Guide:

### Test 3 (Local) Works, Test 5 (Backend) Doesn't Work:
**Diagnosis:** Listeners are fine, issue is with Expo Push delivery
**Solution:** 
- Wait longer (up to 60 seconds)
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify token is correct on backend

### Test 3 (Local) Doesn't Work:
**Diagnosis:** Permission or listener issue
**Solution:**
- Check device notification settings
- Go to Settings → Apps → Expo Go → Notifications
- Enable all notification permissions
- Restart app

### Backend Ping Returns Error:
**Diagnosis:** Backend or authentication issue
**Solution:**
- Check you're logged in
- Check backend is running
- Look at backend terminal for errors

### Token is Empty or Invalid:
**Diagnosis:** Expo push token not generated
**Solution:**
- Ensure using physical device (not emulator)
- Check internet connection
- Restart app and try again

## 📱 Quick Start Commands:

### Option A: Add to Dashboard
Easiest - add button to existing dashboard to open debug screen

### Option B: Direct Navigation (from any screen)
```typescript
navigation.navigate('NotificationDebug');
```

### Option C: Dev Menu
- Shake device
- Open dev menu
- Navigate to NotificationDebug

## ✨ Expected Results:

After running all tests successfully, you should see:

1. ✅ All 7 tests pass with green checkmarks
2. ✅ Local notification appears immediately
3. ✅ Backend ping notification arrives within 30 seconds
4. ✅ When customer places order, admin receives notification
5. ✅ Logs show: `📬 Notification received (foreground)`
6. ✅ Alert popup appears with order details

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing:

1. **If everything works:** Remove debug screen (or keep for production debugging)
2. **If local works but backend delayed:** This is normal, notifications will work in production
3. **If nothing works:** Check the logs and follow diagnosis guide above
