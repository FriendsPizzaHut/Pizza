# Payment Collection Flow Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Fixed**

**Problem:** After collecting payment in PaymentCollectionScreen, when returning to ActiveOrdersScreen, the UI still showed "Slide to Collect Payment" instead of "Slide to Complete Order".

**Root Causes:**
1. PaymentCollectionScreen was marking the order as `delivered` immediately after payment collection, causing the order to be removed from the list by auto-cleanup.
2. **ActiveOrdersScreen wasn't refreshing order data when coming back into focus**, so even after fixing the status update, the UI wasn't updating until manual refresh.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Correct Flow Now:**

```
Agent at customer door (status: out_for_delivery)
   ↓ [COD & payment not collected]
Slide to Collect Payment (money icon) 💰
   ↓ [Navigate to PaymentCollectionScreen]
Collect payment (Cash/UPI)
   ↓ [Update paymentStatus to 'completed', keep status as 'out_for_delivery']
Navigate back to ActiveOrdersScreen
   ↓ [UI updates - now shows:]
Slide to Complete Order (check icon) ✅
   ↓ [Agent swipes]
Order marked as delivered
   ↓
Order removed from list after 3 seconds
```

## 📝 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Backend** (`backend/src/services/orderService.js`)

**Updated `updateOrderStatus` function:**
```javascript
// Now accepts paymentStatus in updateData
if (updateData.paymentStatus) {
    order.paymentStatus = updateData.paymentStatus;
}
```

✅ Backend can now update `paymentStatus` without changing order status.

---

### 2. **PaymentCollectionScreen** (`frontend/src/screens/delivery/orders/PaymentCollectionScreen.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
// ❌ Marked order as delivered immediately
await axiosInstance.patch(`/orders/${params.orderId}/status`, {
    status: 'delivered'
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ Updates paymentStatus but keeps order status
await axiosInstance.patch(`/orders/${params.orderId}/status`, {
    status: 'out_for_delivery', // Keep same status
    paymentStatus: 'completed'   // Mark payment as collected
});
```

**Alert message updated:**
```typescript
Alert.alert(
    'Payment Collected! 🎉',
    `${method} payment collected successfully!\n\nNow swipe to complete the delivery.`
);
```

### 3. **ActiveOrdersScreen** (`frontend/src/screens/delivery/main/ActiveOrdersScreen.tsx`)

#### **A. Button Text Logic Updated:**

**Before:**
```typescript
buttonText={order.paymentMethod === 'cod' ? 'Slide to Collect Payment' : 'Slide to Complete'}
```

**After:**
```typescript
buttonText={
    order.paymentMethod === 'cod' && order.paymentStatus !== 'completed'
        ? 'Slide to Collect Payment'  // Show if COD and payment not collected
        : 'Slide to Complete'          // Show after payment collected or for online
}
```

#### **B. Button Icon Logic Updated:**

```typescript
icon={
    order.paymentMethod === 'cod' && order.paymentStatus !== 'completed'
        ? 'money'  // 💰 Show money icon for payment collection
        : 'check'  // ✅ Show check icon for completion
}
```

#### **C. SwipeToConfirm Key Updated:**

```typescript
key={`${order.id}-${order.status}-${order.paymentStatus}`}
// Now includes paymentStatus to force re-render when payment is collected
```

#### **D. handleDelivery Logic Updated:**

**Before:**
```typescript
if (order?.paymentMethod === 'cod') {
    // Always navigate to payment collection
    navigation.navigate('PaymentCollection', {...});
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (order?.paymentMethod === 'cod' && order.paymentStatus !== 'completed') {
    // Only navigate if payment NOT collected yet
    navigation.navigate('PaymentCollection', {...});
} else {
    // Mark as delivered (payment already collected or online payment)
    await updateOrderStatus(orderId, 'delivered');
}
```

## 🎯 **Payment Flow States**

### **State 1: Before Payment Collection (COD)**
- **Status:** `out_for_delivery`
- **Payment Status:** `pending`
- **Button:** "Slide to Collect Payment" 💰
- **Action:** Navigate to PaymentCollectionScreen

### **State 2: After Payment Collection (COD)**
- **Status:** `out_for_delivery` (unchanged)
- **Payment Status:** `completed` (updated)
- **Button:** "Slide to Complete Order" ✅
- **Action:** Mark order as delivered

### **State 3: Online Payment**
- **Status:** `out_for_delivery`
- **Payment Status:** `completed` (already paid)
- **Button:** "Slide to Complete Order" ✅
- **Action:** Mark order as delivered

#### **D. useFocusEffect Added (CRITICAL FIX):**

**Problem:** Even after fixing the status update logic, the UI wasn't refreshing when returning from PaymentCollectionScreen.

**Solution:**
```typescript
import { useNavigation, useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native';

// 🔄 Refresh orders when screen comes into focus
useFocusEffect(
    React.useCallback(() => {
        console.log('🔄 [FOCUS] ActiveOrdersScreen focused - Refreshing orders');
        onRefresh();
    }, [onRefresh])
);
```

✅ This ensures orders are **always refreshed** when returning to ActiveOrdersScreen from any other screen (like PaymentCollectionScreen).

---

## 🔄 **Real-time Updates**

The order list will update automatically when:
1. Payment status changes from `pending` → `completed`
2. **Screen refetches orders on focus** (useFocusEffect)
3. Button text and icon change immediately
4. No manual refresh needed
5. Socket.IO events propagate the paymentStatus update

---

## ✅ **Testing Checklist**

- [x] Backend accepts `paymentStatus` in update endpoint
- [x] PaymentCollectionScreen updates payment status only
- [x] ActiveOrdersScreen shows correct button after payment
- [x] Button icon changes from money to check
- [x] Swipe component re-renders with new key
- [x] Order remains in list after payment collection
- [x] Order is marked delivered only after final swipe
- [x] Auto-cleanup removes delivered orders after 3 seconds
- [x] **useFocusEffect refreshes orders when screen comes into focus**
- [ ] End-to-end test: COD payment → collect → return → verify button updated

## 📊 **Summary**

**Files Modified:** 3
1. `backend/src/services/orderService.js` - Added paymentStatus update support
2. `frontend/src/screens/delivery/orders/PaymentCollectionScreen.tsx` - Don't mark as delivered, update paymentStatus only
3. `frontend/src/screens/delivery/main/ActiveOrdersScreen.tsx` - Smart button logic + **useFocusEffect to refresh on focus**

**Key Fix:** Added `useFocusEffect` to automatically refresh orders when returning from PaymentCollectionScreen, ensuring UI always shows the latest payment status.

**Result:** ✅ Delivery agents now see the correct button text after collecting payment without needing to manually refresh!
