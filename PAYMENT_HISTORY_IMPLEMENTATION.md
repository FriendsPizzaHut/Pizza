### 2. **Navigation Updates**

#### AdminNavigator (`frontend/src/navigation/AdminNavigator.tsx`)
```typescript
import PaymentHistoryScreen from '../screens/admin/payments/PaymentHistoryScreen';

<Stack.Screen name="PaymentHistory" component={PaymentHistoryScreen} />
```

#### Navigation Types (`frontend/src/types/navigation.ts`)
```typescript
export type AdminStackParamList = {
    // ... other routes
    PaymentHistory: undefined;
};
```

#### ProfileScreen (`frontend/src/screens/admin/main/ProfileScreen.tsx`)
Added new menu option:
```typescript
{
    title: 'Payment History',
    icon: 'payment',
    iconType: 'MaterialIcons',
    color: '#4CAF50',
    bgColor: '#E8F5E9',
    action: () => navigation.navigate('PaymentHistory'),
}
```

## üîß Backend Implementation

### 1. **Payment Controller** 
**Location:** `backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js`

**New Functions:**
- `getCashCollectionsByAgent()` - Get cash collections grouped by delivery agent
- `getPaymentStats()` - Get payment statistics

### 2. **Payment Service** 
**Location:** `backend/src/services/paymentService.js`

**New Functions:**

#### `getCashCollectionsByAgent()`
**Purpose:** Track which delivery agents collected cash and how much

**MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline:**
```javascript
1. Match: COD orders with cash collection, completed status
2. Lookup: Get order details
3. Lookup: Get delivery agent details
4. Group: By delivery agent
   - Calculate total cash collected
   - Count number of deliveries
5. Sort: By total cash (highest first)
```

**Returns:**
```javascript
[
    {
        _id: "agentId",
        name: "Agent Name",
        email: "agent@example.com",
        totalCashCollected: 1500.50,
        deliveryCount: 12
    }
]
```

#### `getPaymentStats()`
**Purpose:** Get overall payment statistics

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
    totalRevenue: 25000.00,
    totalTransactions: 150,
    cashCollections: 5000.00,
    onlinePayments: 20000.00,
    codOrders: 50
}
```

### 3. **Payment Routes** 
**Location:** `backend/src/routes/paymentRoutes.js`

**New Endpoints:**

#### `GET /api/v1/payments/cash-collections-by-agent`
- **Access:** Admin only
- **Returns:** List of agents with cash collections
- **Use Case:** Track cash to collect from delivery agents

#### `GET /api/v1/payments/stats`
- **Access:** Admin only
- **Returns:** Overall payment statistics
- **Use Case:** Dashboard analytics

**Route Order (Important):**
```javascript
// Specific routes MUST come before dynamic /:id routes
router.get('/cash-collections-by-agent', ...);
router.get('/stats', ...);
router.get('/:id', ...); // This catches everything else
```

## üìä Payment Model Structure

**Location:** `backend/src/models/Payment.js`

**Key Fields:**
```javascript
{
    order: ObjectId,              // Reference to Order
    user: ObjectId,               // Reference to User
    amount: Number,               // Payment amount
    paymentMethod: String,        // card, upi, cod, cash, wallet
    collectionMethod: String,     // cash, upi, card (for COD)
    paymentStatus: String,        // pending, completed, failed
    paymentGateway: String,       // razorpay, cash, manual
    transactionId: String,        // Transaction reference
    createdAt: Date,
    updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Sample Document:**
```json
{
    "_id": "68f5005c68c7f53aee37ba6d",
    "order": "68f5000968c7f53aee37ba20",
