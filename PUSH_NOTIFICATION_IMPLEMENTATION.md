# üîî Push Notification System - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: **READY FOR TESTING**

Push notification system fully implemented using **Expo Push Notifications** with optimized architecture for admin, delivery, and customer notifications.

---

## üìã What Was Built

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

#### 1. **DeviceToken Model** (`backend/src/models/DeviceToken.js`)
- Stores device push tokens linked to users
- Fields: `userId`, `token`, `userRole`, `deviceType`, `isActive`
- Automatic token validation and deduplication
- Indexed for fast queries by userId and role

#### 2. **Expo Notification Service** (`backend/src/services/notifications/expoService.js`)
- Centralized notification sending service
- Batch notification support for multiple recipients
- Notification templates for different event types
- Error handling with detailed logging
- Non-blocking async operations

#### 3. **Device Token Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/deviceTokenController.js`)
- API endpoints for token registration
- Token validation and storage
- Duplicate token handling
- Error handling for all operations

#### 4. **Device Token Routes** (`backend/src/routes/deviceTokenRoutes.js`)
- POST `/api/v1/device-tokens` - Register device token
- Authentication required

#### 5. **Order Controller Integration** (`backend/src/controllers/orderController.js`)
- Integrated notifications into order creation flow
- Sends notifications to all admin users when new order is created
- Non-blocking notification calls (won't delay order creation)

---

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)

#### 1. **Notification Service** (`frontend/src/services/notifications/NotificationService.ts`)
- Singleton service for managing push notifications
- Permission handling (iOS + Android)
- Expo push token generation
- Device token registration with backend
- Foreground notification configuration
- Notification listeners (received + tapped)
- Android notification channel setup
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

#### 2. **Notification Types** (`frontend/src/types/notification.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces for all notification payloads
- Notification handler callback types
- Device token registration types
- Strongly typed notification data structures

#### 3. **useNotifications Hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`)
- React hook for notification lifecycle management
- Memoized callbacks for performance
- Automatic cleanup on unmount
- Single initialization guard
- Easy-to-use API

#### 4. **NotificationInitializer Component** (`frontend/src/components/common/NotificationInitializer.tsx`)
- Invisible component that initializes notifications
- Handles foreground notifications with Alert
- Navigation on notification tap
- Role-based screen navigation
- Integrated with Redux auth state

#### 5. **Admin Navigator Integration** (`frontend/src/navigation/AdminNavigator.tsx`)
- NotificationInitializer added to admin navigator
- Automatically initializes for logged-in admin users
- Handles notification taps to navigate to order details

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Notification Flow

```
Customer Places Order
        ‚Üì
Backend creates order
        ‚Üì
Order Controller calls notificationService.notifyAdmins()
        ‚Üì
Service queries all admin device tokens
        ‚Üì
Sends batch notification via Expo Push Service
        ‚Üì
Expo pushes to devices
        ‚Üì
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí App Closed: System notification appears
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí App Background: Banner notification appears
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí App Open: Alert dialog shown (foreground handler)
```

### Debugging

Check console logs for these key indicators:

```
üîî [NOTIFICATIONS] Initializing notification system...
‚úÖ [NOTIFICATIONS] Permission granted
‚úÖ [NOTIFICATIONS] Expo push token: ExponentPushToken[xxxxx]
üì§ [NOTIFICATIONS] Registering token with backend...
‚úÖ [NOTIFICATIONS] Token registered successfully
‚úÖ [NOTIFICATIONS] Initialization complete
```

If notification isn't received:

```
üì¨ [NotificationInitializer] Foreground notification: {...}
```

If notification is tapped:

```
üëÜ [NotificationInitializer] Notification tapped: {...}
üìç [NotificationInitializer] Navigating to order: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No push token available"

**Cause:** Permission not granted or physical device not used

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're using a physical device (not simulator)
- Check app permissions in device settings
- Delete and reinstall app to trigger permission prompt

---

### Problem: "Failed to register token with backend"

**Cause:** Backend not reachable or API endpoint issue

**Solution:**
- Check backend is running
- Verify API URL in Constants configuration
- Check network connection
- Look at backend logs for errors

---

### Problem: Notification not received when app is closed (iOS)

**Cause:** Expo Go limitation for push notifications

**Solution:**
- This is expected behavior in Expo Go
- Build production iOS app with `eas build`
- Or test on Android which works in Expo Go

---

### Problem: Notification received but navigation not working

**Cause:** Navigation state not ready or incorrect route name

**Solution:**
- Check navigation route names match exactly
- Ensure NavigationContainer is mounted
- Verify orderId exists in notification data

---

    // Handle foreground notification
    Alert.alert(
      notification.request.content.title,
      notification.request.content.body
    );
  },
  onNotificationTap: (response) => {
    // Handle notification tap
    const orderId = response.notification.request.content.data.orderId;
    navigation.navigate('OrderDetails', { orderId });
