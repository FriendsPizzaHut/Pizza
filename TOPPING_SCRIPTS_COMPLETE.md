## ✅ Testing Results

**Test Command:**
```bash
npm run toppings:list
```

**Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS!**

```
✅ Connected to MongoDB
Database: pizza-delivery

📋 LIST TOPPINGS

Current Toppings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🥬 VEGETABLES (8)
   ✓ Onion, Tomato, Capsicum, Mushroom, Corn, Jalapeno, Olives, Bell Pepper

🍖 MEAT (5)
   ✓ Chicken, Chicken Sausage, Pepperoni, Chicken Tikka, BBQ Chicken

🧀 CHEESE (4)
   ✓ Mozzarella, Cheddar, Parmesan, Paneer

🍅 SAUCE (4)
   ✓ Tomato Sauce, White Sauce, BBQ Sauce, Peri Peri Sauce

Total: 21 toppings (21 active, 0 inactive)
```

**Observation:** The database already had toppings loaded (probably from the `RestaurantSettings.getSingleton()` method which adds default toppings automatically).

## 📋 Available Commands

### Quick Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run toppings:list` | 📋 Show all toppings (tested ✅) |

## 🎨 Features

### 1. **Color-Coded Output**

## 📊 Sample Data Included

The scripts include 23 sample toppings:

- **🥬 Vegetables (8)**: Onion, Tomato, Capsicum, Mushroom, Corn, Jalapeno, Olives, Bell Pepper
- **🍖 Meat (5)**: Chicken, Chicken Sausage, Pepperoni, Chicken Tikka, BBQ Chicken
- **🧀 Cheese (4)**: Mozzarella, Cheddar, Parmesan, Paneer

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Backend Model
```javascript
// RestaurantSettings.js already has:
availableToppings: [{
    name: { type: String, required: true, trim: true },
    category: { 
        type: String, 
        enum: ['vegetables', 'meat', 'cheese', 'sauce'], 
        required: true 
    },
    isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true }
}]
```

### API Endpoint
```
GET /api/restaurant-settings
```
Returns `availableToppings` array.

### Frontend Access
```typescript
// Restaurant Settings Screen
const settings = await getRestaurantSettings();
const toppings = settings.availableToppings; // Array of Topping objects
```

## 📝 Notes

1. **Default Toppings**: Your database already has 21 toppings, likely initialized by the `RestaurantSettings.getSingleton()` method.

2. **Note on Count**: Script shows 21 toppings instead of 23. This suggests either:
   - Two toppings were not added in the initial setup
   - Two toppings were deleted previously
   - The model's default initialization has slightly different data

3. **All Active**: All 21 toppings are currently active (available for customers).

4. **Categories**: Well-distributed across all 4 categories.
