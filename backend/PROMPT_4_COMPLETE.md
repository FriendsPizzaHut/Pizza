## üîß Key Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Consistent Error Handling
- All controllers use `try-catch` blocks
- Prevents server crashes from unhandled errors
- Consistent error responses to clients

### ‚úÖ JSON Response Format
All responses follow the pattern:
```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "message": "Description",
  "data": {}
}
```

### ‚úÖ Modular Architecture
- Controllers contain business logic
- Routes define endpoints
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain and extend

### ‚úÖ Data Validation
- Product existence validation in order creation
- Duplicate coupon code validation
- User existence checks before operations
- Input validation in all controllers

### ‚úÖ Cascade Operations
- User deletion cascades to orders, payments, notifications
- Maintains data integrity

### ‚úÖ Query Features
- Pagination in user listing
- Category filtering in products
- Status filtering in notifications
- Date-based filtering in activity logs

## üìù App.js Route Mounting

All routes are now mounted in `src/app.js`:

```javascript
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
app.use('/api/business', businessRoutes);
app.use('/api/products', productRoutes);
app.use('/api/orders', orderRoutes);
app.use('/api/payments', paymentRoutes);
app.use('/api/coupons', couponRoutes);
app.use('/api/notifications', notificationRoutes);
app.use('/api/activity', activityRoutes);
```

---

## üîê Security Notes

**Auth Middleware (To Be Added):**
- All routes have comments indicating where auth middleware will be applied
- Admin-only routes identified (products, payments, coupons, activity)
- User-specific routes identified (orders, notifications)

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Apply `auth` middleware to protected routes
2. Apply `isAdmin` middleware to admin-only routes
3. Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
4. Implement JWT token refresh mechanism

## üß™ Testing Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Auth
```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"John","email":"john@example.com","password":"pass123"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"pass123"}'
```

### Products
```bash
# Get all products
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products

# Get by category
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products?category=pizza
```

### Orders
```bash
# Create order
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user":"userId","items":[{"product":"productId","quantity":2}]}'
```

   - Add role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Implement JWT refresh tokens

2. **Input Validation**
   - Add express-validator or Joi

   - Add custom validation middleware

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for controllers
   - Write integration tests for routes
   - Add test coverage reporting

4. **Documentation**
   - Generate Swagger/OpenAPI docs
   - Add JSDoc comments
   - Create API usage guide

5. **Performance**
   - Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Implement database indexes
   - Add query optimization

6. **Monitoring**
   - Add request logging
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Add error tracking (Sentry)

## üìå Important Notes

- All endpoints are currently **unprotected** (no auth middleware applied yet)
- Admin routes are marked with comments but not enforced yet
- The structure is ready for easy middleware integration
- All controllers follow the same pattern for consistency
