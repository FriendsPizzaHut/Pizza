## 🎮 How to Use Your Optimized App

### 1. **App Integration** ✅ COMPLETE
Your `App.tsx` is now fully integrated with:
- Performance Provider wrapping
- Automatic system initialization
- Development tools integration
- Error handling and monitoring

### 2. **Development Tools**
```typescript
// In development console:
import("./src/utils/performanceTesting").then(m => {
    m.PerformanceDevTools.runTestSuite()       // Run full test suite
    m.PerformanceDevTools.triggerStressTest()  // Stress test app
    m.PerformanceDevTools.simulateMemoryPressure() // Memory testing
})
```

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from './src/utils/performance';

// Get real-time metrics
const metrics = performanceMonitor.getCurrentMetrics();
console.log(`FPS: ${metrics.fps}, Memory: ${metrics.memory.used}MB`);
```

### 4. **Component Migration**
Replace standard components with optimized versions:
- `FlatList` → `UltraOptimizedList`
- `Image` → `OptimizedImage`  
- Redux selectors → Zustand selectors
- Direct imports → Lazy loading
