# üêõ Runtime Error Fix: whyDidYouRender Issue

## Issue
After successful EAS build, the app crashed on startup with:
```
TypeError: Invalid attempt to spread non-iterable instance
```

This error came from `whyDidYouRender` performance debugging tool trying to track React hooks.

---

## Root Cause

**Why Did You Render** is a development tool that tracks React component re-renders. The issue:

1. It was enabled in `__DEV__` mode
2. EAS development builds have `__DEV__ === true`
3. The `trackHooks: true` option causes compatibility issues with React Native's hook implementation
4. It tries to spread non-iterable hook data, causing the crash

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### 1. **Disabled whyDidYouRender for EAS Builds**

**File: `App.tsx`**
```typescript
// OLD (caused crash):
if (__DEV__) {
  import('./src/utils/whyDidYouRender');
}

// NEW (works correctly):
if (__DEV__ && !process.env.EAS_BUILD) {
  import('./src/utils/whyDidYouRender').catch(() => {
    console.log('Why Did You Render not loaded');
  });
}
```

**File: `src/utils/performanceInit.tsx`**
```typescript
// OLD:
import './whyDidYouRender';

// NEW:
if (__DEV__ && !process.env.EAS_BUILD) {
    try {
        require('./whyDidYouRender');
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('Why Did You Render not loaded');
    }
}
```

### 2. **Disabled Hook Tracking (Fallback)**

**File: `src/utils/whyDidYouRender.ts`**
```typescript
whyDidYouRender(React, {
    trackAllPureComponents: false,  // Reduced overhead
    trackHooks: false,               // DISABLED - causes crashes
    trackExtraHooks: false,          // DISABLED
    // ... rest of config
});
```

### 3. **Added Error Handling**
```typescript
try {
    // whyDidYouRender initialization
} catch (error) {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Why Did You Render failed to initialize:', error);
}
```

## üì± How to Test

### Option 1: Use the Current Development Build
Your Metro server should now work correctly with the downloaded APK:

```bash
cd /home/naitik2408/Contribution/pizza2/frontend
npx expo start --dev-client
```

Then open the app on your device - it should connect without crashing.

### Option 2: Rebuild for Complete Fix
For a clean build with all fixes:

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

---

## üîç When whyDidYouRender WILL Run

‚úÖ **Local development with Metro**: `npx expo start`
- Environment: `__DEV__ = true` and `EAS_BUILD = undefined`
- whyDidYouRender: **ENABLED** (but with safe settings)

## When whyDidYouRender WON'T Run

‚ùå **EAS Development builds**
- Environment: `__DEV__ = true` and `EAS_BUILD = true`
- whyDidYouRender: **DISABLED**

‚ùå **Production builds**
- Environment: `__DEV__ = false`
- whyDidYouRender: **DISABLED**

---

## üéØ Current Status

### Fixed Files:
1. ‚úÖ `App.tsx` - Conditional import with EAS_BUILD check
2. ‚úÖ `src/utils/performanceInit.tsx` - Conditional require with error handling
3. ‚úÖ `src/utils/whyDidYouRender.ts` - Disabled hook tracking + added try-catch

### What Changed:
- Hook tracking disabled (was causing the crash)
- EAS builds skip whyDidYouRender entirely
- Local development still has performance debugging
- Added error boundaries to prevent crashes

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Action:
1. **Restart your Metro server** (if running):
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   cd /home/naitik2408/Contribution/pizza2/frontend
   npx expo start --dev-client --clear
   ```

2. **Open your downloaded APK** and connect to Metro

3. **Test login/signup** functionality

### If Still Having Issues:

Check if the old bundle is cached:
```bash
npx expo start --dev-client --clear
```

Or rebuild:
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

---

## üí° Why This Happened

**Development Tools ‚â† Production-Ready**

- `whyDidYouRender` is designed for local React development
- React Native's hook implementation differs from React DOM
- EAS development builds run optimized code, not local dev code
- Hook tracking in RN can cause iterator protocol issues

**Lesson**: Always test dev tools in the actual environment they'll run in (EAS, local dev, production).

---

## üîÑ Trade-offs

### What You Lose:
- No whyDidYouRender in EAS development builds
- Slightly less performance debugging info

### What You Gain:
- ‚úÖ App actually works and doesn't crash
- ‚úÖ Still have performance monitoring (via `performanceMonitor`)
- ‚úÖ Still have all other optimizations (image cache, lazy loading, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Local development still has full debugging

---

## üìä Alternative Performance Debugging

You still have these tools available:

1. **React DevTools**: Connect via Metro
2. **Flipper**: Use with development builds
3. **Performance Monitor**: Built into your app
4. **Console logging**: Still works everywhere
5. **Chrome DevTools**: Remote debugging

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED - Ready to Test**

*Your app should now start without crashing!*
