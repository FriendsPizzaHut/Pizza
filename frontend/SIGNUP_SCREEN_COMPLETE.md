# ✅ Navigation Fix Complete - Signup Screen Added

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Error:** `The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload {"name":"Register"} was not handled by any navigator.`

**Root Cause:** 
- Login component was trying to navigate to 'Register' screen
- But AuthNavigator only had 'Login' screen defined
- No SignupScreen component existed

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive Signup Component (`src/components/auth/Signup.tsx`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Real API integration with `signupThunk`
- ✅ Form validation (name, email, phone, password)
- ✅ Loading states with spinner
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Offline detection with banner
- ✅ Password strength validation (min 6 chars)
- ✅ Confirm password matching
- ✅ Field-specific error highlighting
- ✅ Security (secure text entry, input sanitization)
- ✅ Beautiful UI with animations

**Validation Rules:**
```typescript
✓ Name: Min 2 characters
✓ Email: Valid format (regex)
✓ Phone: 10 digits, starts with 6-9 (Indian)
✓ Password: Min 6 characters
✓ Confirm Password: Must match password
```

### 2. Created SignupScreen Wrapper (`src/screens/auth/SignupScreen.tsx`)
Simple wrapper that renders the Signup component.

### 3. Updated AuthNavigator (`src/navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx`)
Added Register screen to the navigator:
```typescript
<Stack.Screen name="Register" component={SignupScreen} />
```

## 🎨 UI Features

### Offline Banner
```
🌐 You're offline. Connect to internet to sign up.
```

### Error Banner (Global)
```
⚠️ An account with this email already exists
```

### Field Validation Errors
- Shows below each input field
- Red border around error field
- Clear error on input change

### Loading State
