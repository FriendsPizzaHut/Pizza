# Time Block Chart Enhancement (4-Hour Blocks)

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Feature:** Replace 13 hourly bars with 6 time block bars (4-hour intervals)

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### Issue:
- 13 hourly bars (9AM-9PM) took too much horizontal space
- Bars were cramped and hard to read on mobile
- Labels overlapped and were difficult to scan

### Solution:
- Group hours into 6 time blocks (4 hours each)
- Each block covers a 4-hour period
- Better space utilization and readability

---

## ⏰ Time Block Structure

### 6 Blocks Covering 24 Hours:

| Block # | Time Range | Hours Included |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **12AM-4AM** | 12AM, 1AM, 2AM, 3AM |
| 2 | **4AM-8AM** | 4AM, 5AM, 6AM, 7AM |
| 3 | **8AM-12PM** | 8AM, 9AM, 10AM, 11AM |
| 4 | **12PM-4PM** | 12PM, 1PM, 2PM, 3PM |
| 5 | **4PM-8PM** | 4PM, 5PM, 6PM, 7PM |
| 6 | **8PM-12AM** | 8PM, 9PM, 10PM, 11PM |

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Full 24-hour coverage
- ✅ Equal 4-hour intervals
- ✅ Clear time range labels
- ✅ Aggregated revenue and orders per block

## 💡 Implementation Details

### 1. **Time Block Data Calculation**

```typescript
const timeBlockData = useMemo(() => {
    // Define 6 time blocks
    const timeBlocks = [
        { label: '12AM-4AM', hours: ['12AM', '1AM', '2AM', '3AM'] },
        { label: '4AM-8AM', hours: ['4AM', '5AM', '6AM', '7AM'] },
        { label: '8AM-12PM', hours: ['8AM', '9AM', '10AM', '11AM'] },
        { label: '12PM-4PM', hours: ['12PM', '1PM', '2PM', '3PM'] },
        { label: '4PM-8PM', hours: ['4PM', '5PM', '6PM', '7PM'] },
        { label: '8PM-12AM', hours: ['8PM', '9PM', '10PM', '11PM'] },
    ];

    // Aggregate hourly data into blocks
    return timeBlocks.map((block) => {
        let totalRevenue = 0;
        let totalOrders = 0;

        // Sum all hours in this block
        hourlyData.forEach((hourData) => {
            if (block.hours.includes(hourData.hour)) {
                totalRevenue += hourData.revenue || 0;
                totalOrders += hourData.orders || 0;
            }
        });

        return {
            timeRange: block.label,
            revenue: totalRevenue,
            orders: totalOrders,
        };
    });
}, [hourlyData]);
```

**Logic:**
- Takes hourly data from backend (9AM-9PM typically)
- Groups into predefined 4-hour blocks
- Sums revenue and orders for each block
- Returns 6 aggregated data points

### 2. **Max Revenue Calculation**

```typescript
const maxTimeBlockRevenue = useMemo(() => {
    if (timeBlockData.length === 0) return 1;
    const max = Math.max(...timeBlockData.map((d) => d.revenue));
    return max === 0 ? 1 : max; // Prevent division by zero
}, [timeBlockData]);
```

### 3. **Chart Rendering**

```tsx
{timeBlockData.map((block, index) => {
    const calculatedHeight = (block.revenue / maxTimeBlockRevenue) * 140;
    const barHeight = block.revenue === 0 ? 12 : Math.max(calculatedHeight, 12);
    const isPeak = block.revenue === maxTimeBlockRevenue && block.revenue > 0;
    const isZero = block.revenue === 0;

    return (
        <View key={index} style={styles.timeBlockBarWrapper}>
            {/* Bar with gradient */}
            <LinearGradient
                colors={
                    isZero ? ['#E0E0E0', '#BDBDBD'] :
                    isPeak ? ['#cb202d', '#a01823'] :
                    ['#FF9800', '#F57C00']
                }
                style={[styles.timeBlockBar, { height: barHeight }]}
            >
                {isPeak && <StarIcon />}
            </LinearGradient>
            
            {/* Label */}
            <Text>{block.timeRange}</Text>
            
            {/* Orders badge */}
            <View>
                <Text>{block.orders} orders</Text>
            </View>
        </View>
    );
})}
```

## 📊 Data Aggregation Examples

### Example 1: Lunch & Dinner Rush
```
Backend hourly data:
- 11AM: ₹500, 20 orders
- 12PM: ₹1200, 45 orders
- 1PM: ₹1500, 60 orders
- 2PM: ₹800, 30 orders

Aggregated to 12PM-4PM block:
- Total: ₹4000, 155 orders
```

### Example 2: Late Night (No Data)
```
Backend hourly data:
- 8PM: ₹600, 25 orders
- 9PM: ₹400, 15 orders
- (10PM-11PM: No data)

Aggregated to 8PM-12AM block:
- Total: ₹1000, 40 orders
```

### Example 3: Morning Quiet Hours
```
Backend hourly data:
- (12AM-7AM: No data)

Aggregated blocks:
- 12AM-4AM: ₹0, 0 orders (gray bar)
- 4AM-8AM: ₹0, 0 orders (gray bar)
```

## 🎨 Styling

### Bar Styles:
```typescript
timeBlockBar: {
    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: 48,        // Wider than hourly bars (was 28)
    borderRadius: 8,
    minHeight: 20,
    // Gradient support via LinearGradient
}

timeBlockBarWrapper: {
    flex: 1,
    marginHorizontal: 2,  // Small spacing between bars
}

timeBlockLabel: {
    fontSize: 9,
    fontWeight: '700',
    textAlign: 'center',  // Center-aligned labels
}
```

### Colors:
- **Zero/No Data:** Gray (#E0E0E0)
- **Normal Period:** Orange gradient (#FF9800 → #F57C00)
- **Peak Period:** Red gradient (#cb202d → #a01823) with ⭐

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Mobile View:
- 6 bars fit comfortably across screen
- Labels don't overlap
- Touch targets are adequately sized

### Tablet View:
- Bars have more spacing
- Larger font sizes still readable

### Bar Width Calculation:
```typescript
// Container uses flex: 1 distribution
// Each bar: flex: 1, marginHorizontal: 2
// Result: Equal width, proportional spacing
```

## 🕐 Business Insights

### What You Can Learn:

1. **Peak Business Hours:**
   - Which 4-hour block has highest revenue?
   - Example: "4PM-8PM is our busiest period"

2. **Quiet Hours:**
   - Which blocks have zero or low sales?
   - Example: "12AM-8AM shows no activity"

3. **Revenue Distribution:**
   - How is revenue spread across the day?
   - Example: "80% revenue comes from 12PM-8PM"

4. **Operational Planning:**
   - When to schedule more staff?
   - When to run promotions?

## 🧪 Edge Cases Handled

1. ✅ **No hourly data** → All 6 blocks show as gray bars
2. ✅ **Partial data** → Missing hours treated as zero
3. ✅ **Backend only returns 9AM-9PM** → Other blocks show zero
4. ✅ **All blocks zero** → maxTimeBlockRevenue = 1 (no division by zero)
5. ✅ **Single high block** → Shows as peak with star

## ⚡ Performance

| Metric | Before (13 bars) | After (6 blocks) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Render Time** | Normal | Faster (fewer elements) |
| **Memory** | Normal | Less (6 vs 13 components) |
| **Calculations** | 13 bar heights | 6 bar heights + aggregation |
| **Memoization** | Yes | Yes |
| **Re-renders** | On hourlyData change | On hourlyData change |

**Net Performance:** Slightly better due to fewer DOM elements

## 🎓 Key Improvements

### Before → After:

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Bars** | 13 hourly | 6 time blocks |
| **Width** | Cramped (28px max) | Spacious (48px max) |
| **Labels** | Hour (9AM, 10AM) | Range (8AM-12PM) |
| **Readability** | Difficult | Easy |
| **Mobile UX** | Crowded | Comfortable |
| **Data Density** | High (detailed) | Medium (aggregated) |
| **Business Insight** | Hour-by-hour | Period-by-period |

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Admins:

**Understanding the Chart:**
- Each bar = 4 hours of business
- Taller bar = More revenue in that period
- Red bar with ⭐ = Peak revenue period
- Gray bar = No sales in that period

**Making Decisions:**
- **Peak period** (red bar): Schedule more staff, ensure inventory
- **Quiet periods** (gray/small bars): Reduce staff, run promotions
- **Consistent periods** (similar heights): Standard operations

---

## 🎯 Summary

**What Changed:**
- Hourly chart → Time block chart
- 13 bars → 6 bars (4-hour blocks)
- Individual hours → Aggregated periods
- Cramped layout → Spacious, readable design

**Why It's Better:**
- ✅ Better use of horizontal space
- ✅ Easier to read on mobile
- ✅ Clearer business insights
- ✅ Less visual clutter
- ✅ Faster rendering (fewer elements)

**How It Works:**
- Backend sends hourly data (9AM-9PM typically)
- Frontend groups into 6 predefined 4-hour blocks
- Revenue and orders summed per block
- Chart displays 6 wider, more readable bars

**The time block chart provides a cleaner, more business-focused view of daily sales patterns!** 🎉
